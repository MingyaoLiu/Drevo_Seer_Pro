Bought a Drevo Seer Pro 60% keyboard with Gateron Red switch, best budget keyboard ever. Repo is for all resources about this keyboard, and me trying to hack it.


# Shortcut

## LOCK ARROW KEY 
Hold `leftControl` `Fn` at the same time to enable/disable this feature.
When active, `left Control` key is static pink color, no matter what light effect you are on.
Now the right Arrow keys are locked in, so you no longer need to press `Fn` to use arrow key. 
Now `right Alt` is `left` Arrow, you now press `Fn` + `rightAlt` to get `rightAlt`.
Confirm this state is preserved even when rebooted keyboard

I didn't know this lock arrow key feature, and I discovered it by accident. Then I went back to check the user manual, and it does show this shortcut. But just writing it down here for people who is trying to google a solution.
