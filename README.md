Bought a Drevo Seer Pro 60% keyboard with Gateron Red switch, best budget keyboard ever. Repo is for all resources about this keyboard, and me trying to hack it.


# Shortcut not in user manual

## LOCK ARROW KEY 
Hold `leftShift` `leftControl` `rightShift` `Fn` at the same time to enable/disable this feature.
When active, `left Control` key is static pink color, no matter what light effect you are on.
Now the right Arrow keys are locked in, so you no longer need to press `Fn` to use arrow key. 
Now `right Alt` is `left` Arrow, you now press `Fn` + `rightAlt` to get `rightAlt`.
Confirm this state is preserved even when rebooted keyboard

This is quite amazing, I was trying to get it into recovery mode to debug this keyboard, by pressing both shifts together, and I accidentally locked my arrow key. I first thought the `Fn` got stuck, but I tried other keys that require Fn key like Del End, and they still require Fn to be pressed to activate. Then during my trying to reproduce this, I got the arrow keys unlocked again. took me an hour of testing to discovered this feature. 

Now you don't have to. And remap of Fn key is still not achievable, the Drevo Power Console's remap of Fn doesn't work. But for me, I was really trying to move the arrow keys to the end of the keyboard, so that `/?` is still symbols, and use shift and the three keys below for arrows.
